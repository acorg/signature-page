** Import
*** Newick
*** json
** Export
*** Newick
- omit hidden subtrees
*** json
- with sequences, clades, aa substs hz lines etc. to be able to draw everything
*** text
*** html
*** data.csv and tree.newick for https://github.com/acorg/isig
** Processing
*** Obtain sequences and hi-namses from seqdb
*** Obtain sequences from fasta
*** Infer subtype, lineage
*** Ladderize
*** Re-root
- kills Cumulative edge length
*** Cumulative edge length
*** Infer long branch subtrees
*** Infer AA subst for subrees ("to" part of AA)
*** Infer "from" part of AA subst
*** Infer clades
- regular clades
  - remove small clades
- H1 183P subclades
- B/Vic 2del and 3del
*** Infer vaccines
*** Infer hz sections
- AA subst for a section (to be shown in the map title)
- hide/show sections
*** Infer Continents
- and countries
*** Stat by month for time series
- TimeSeriesDraw::all_months
*** Hide subtrees and leaves
- hide-isolated-before
- hide-if-cumulative-edge-length-bigger-than
- hide by aa
- hide-between
- hide-one
- hide-not-found-in-chart
*** AAAtPosDraw
- find_most_diverse_positions
- infer sections: make_aa_pos_sections
*** Match antigens from chart
- tracked antigens for each section
- tracked sera for each section
  - egg/cell/reasortant matched
  - all matched by antigen name without passage
